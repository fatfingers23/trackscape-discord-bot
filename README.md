  # Developer setup
  This guide will help you get started with running TrackScape to make changes
  ## Requirements
  * [RustðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  * Docker or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
     * Rather not use docker? Then make sure you have a redis and mongo db instance running
  * Create a dev discord bot. [Can follow this great discord.py] guide(https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html). Need to make sure you have MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT toggled on for access to message content for when developing any features that read discord messages and send them to the TrackScape plugin.
  * Make a copy of [.env.save](.env.save)
    * `MONGO_USERNAME` and `MONGO_PASSWORD` can be w/e you like to secure your development server
    * `DISCORD_TOKEN` This is the discord token created from setting up a discord bot
    * `MANAGEMENT_API_KEY` can be set to w/e. It is used to password protect some endpoints of the API for communication between the bot and the api
    * `DEV_GUILD_ID` is the id of your discord server that is hosting your TrackScape discord bot
  * The bot and api are ran via [shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle). But uses an older version. So may find you need to install it via `cargo binstall cargo-shuttle -y --version 0.37.0`

## Setup
1. Make sure docker desktop is running and run `docker compose up -d` in the root of the project. Or make sure your monogodb and redis services are running
2. Run the project with `cargo shuttle run`. And that's it! The API and bot should be running.

## Further setup or questions
If you do have any issues or questions can join the bots discord and feel free to ask questions there! [TrackScape Discord](https://discord.gg/kRM6Ydf5j9)
